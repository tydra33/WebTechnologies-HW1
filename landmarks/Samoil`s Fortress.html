        <p>Samuel's Fortress (Macedonian: Самуилова тврдина, Bulgarian: Самуилова крепост) is a fortress in the old town
            of
            Ohrid, North Macedonia. It was the capital of the First Bulgarian Empire during the rule of Tsar Samuel of
            Bulgaria at the turn of the 11th century. Today, this historical monument is a major tourist attraction and
            was
            heavily restored in 2003 with the addition of entirely new battlements where none had survived.</p>
        <p>According to recent excavations by Macedonian archaeologists, it was contended that this fortress was built
            on
            the place of an earlier fortification, dated to the 4th century BC, which was probably built by King Philip
            II
            of Macedon.</p>
