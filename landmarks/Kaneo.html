        <p>Saint John the Theologian, Kaneo (Macedonian: Свети Јован Канео, Latinic: Sveti Jovan Kaneo) or simply Saint
            John
            at Kaneo is a Macedonian Orthodox church situated on the cliff over Kaneo Beach overlooking Lake Ohrid in
            the
            city of Ohrid, North Macedonia. The church is dedicated to John of Patmos, the writer of Revelation, who has
            been by some considered to be the same person as John the Apostle. The construction date of the church
            remains
            unknown but documents detailing the church property suggest that it was built before the year 1447.
            Archaeologists believe that the church was constructed some time before the rise of the Ottoman Empire very
            likely in the 13th century. Restoration work in 1964 led to the discovery of frescoes in its dome.</p>
        <p>The church has a cruciform architectural plan, with a rectangular base. The architect of the church is
            unknown.
            Reconstruction work was carried out on the church in the 14th century, shortly before the arrival of Ottoman
            Turks in Macedonia. A wooden iconostasis was constructed within the church and by the 20th century numerous
            saints along with the Virgin Mary have been portrayed on the apse. A fresco of Christ Pantocrator can be
            seen on
            the dome of the church. A fresco of Saint Clement of Ohrid (whose monastery, Saint Panteleimon, is located
            close
            to the church) accompanied by Saint Erasmus of Ohrid can also be seen on a wall of the church.</p>
