        <p>The Robevi House is a famous and historic building in Ohrid, North Macedonia. It was built in its current
            state in 1863–1864 by Todor Petkov from a village Gari near Debar. Today the house is a protected cultural
            monument and belongs to the Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments and National Museum. The building
            of the first Robevi house was finished on 15 April 1827, as witnessed by the inscription on the marbled
            flagstone it is a traditional Ottoman Turkish house architecture. This famous Ohrid merchant family lived in
            the house for 35 years when between 1861–1862 a famous criminal from Ohrid Ustref Beg burnt it to the
            ground. Two years later, between 1863–1864 the house was rebuilt. It was divided in two parts: left and
            right. Konstantin Robev lived in the left part of the house and his brother Atanas Robev in the right part.
            The main builder was Todor Petkov who built the house from scratch. </p>
        <p>The house is a protected cultural monument consisting of three floors. Epigraphical monuments from Ohrid are
            placed on the ground part of the house including precious objects as the "Milokas" (found on the Via
            Egnatia) road, the two torsos of the goddess Isis etc. The archaeological objects from ancient times and the
            medieval period are exhibited on the second and third floors. The upper part of the house serves as
            exhibition space for objects made by the Ohrid carving school,
            creations of famous artists from Ohrid and the county. In the eastern part of the house some objects from
