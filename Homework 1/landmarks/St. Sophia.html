        <p>The Church of Saint Sophia (Macedonian: Црква Света Софија, romanized: Crkva Sveta Sofija) is a church in
            Ohrid,
            North Macedonia. The church is one of the most important monuments of North Macedonia, housing architecture
            and
            art from the Middle Ages.</p>
        <p>The current church was built on the foundations of a metropolitan cathedral demolished in the first decade of
            the
            6th century by the Barbarian invasions. The next church was built during the First Bulgarian Empire,
            after the official conversion to Christianity. Some sources date the building of the church during the rule
            of
            Knyaz Boris I (852 – 889). It was basically rebuilt in the last decade of the 10th century as a patriarchal
            cathedral in the form of a dome basilica, after the replacement of the capital of Bulgaria in Ohrid, during
            the
            reign of Tsar Samuil, when the church was the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate, an autocephalous
            Patriarchate. Later it became a seat of the Archbishopric of Ohrid, under the Patriarchate of Constantinople
            until the 18th century. It was converted into a mosque during the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The interior
            of
            the church has been preserved with frescoes from the 11th, 12th and 13th century, which represent some of
            the
            most significant achievements in Byzantine painting of the time. The main part of the church was built in
            the
            11th century, while external additions were built by Archbishop Gregory II in the 14th century.</p>
