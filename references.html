        The <b>Map Page</b> has the following functionalities:
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can click on the blue markers and an info window will appear.
            In this info window you can click "Read More" to open up a page with information and
            pictures of the selected landmark.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can add a custom (yellow) marker by clicking on the map once you've entered a valid name in the "Insert
            Marker Label" filed. Note that the name cannot be empty and duplicate names are not allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can move your custom (yellow) markers around by dragging them. You can also delete them by double
            clicking them. Your custom markers are stored in local storage (which is updated when you move/delete a
            marker). You cannot delete/move blue markers, you may only hide them.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can hide the landmarks (blue markers) by checking "Hide Points of Interest". You can uncheck it
            for the blue markers to reappear.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may insert the name of any marker (blue/landmark or yellow/custom) in the "Search Marker"
            field and then click the bordered button in order to find the specified marker. Alerts will pop
            up for invalid/non-existent markers.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
